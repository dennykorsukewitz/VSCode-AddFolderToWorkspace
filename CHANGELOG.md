### Initial release of AddFolderToWorkspace extension

**AddFolderToWorkspace** is an extension that adds the selected folder to the workspace (VSC Workspace).
Of course, you can use the already built-in function (`workbench.action.addRootFolder`). But then you have to click through all the folders again and again.
